### 👋 Hi, I'm Mursal Abdikadir

UW '23 grad building my IT support skills — one lab, script, and user question at a time.

🔧 Things I’ve worked on:  
- Helping users troubleshoot Windows/macOS issues (Wi-Fi, updates, printers — the usual suspects)  
- Scripting small automations in Python & PowerShell  
- Analyzing network traffic with Wireshark (thanks, Prof. Dnayak’s info sec class!)  
- Building a simple website for a local artist — and teaching them how to update it  

🌱 Learning in public. All code/docs come from real practice — not tutorials.
