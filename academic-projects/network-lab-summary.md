# UW Network Engineering Lab — Winter 2022

## Environment
Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.1), simulated 2500-series routers & 2960 switches

## What I Configured
- IPv4 & IPv6 addressing with VLSM  
- Static + RIP routing  
- VLANs (Sales, IT, Guest) with inter-VLAN routing  
- Password recovery on a “locked” switch (ROMMON mode)  
- Basic ACL to block ICMP from Guest VLAN

## Key Takeaway
Understanding how misconfigured gateways or subnet masks cause “partial connectivity” — a common user report.
